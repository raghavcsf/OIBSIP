My Oasis Infobyte Java Programming Internship Tasks Includes-

Task 1 : Number Guessing Game

I have developed a number guessing game in which a user is given 3 attempts to guess the correct number. On a successful guess, the user gets some points. The points get decreased with each failed attempt.

Task 2 : ATM Interface

This is a small banking application which first prompts the user to submit userid and pin. And then the ATM interface is displayed to user by which he/she can perform the following operations:

1. Transaction History 
2. Withdraw
3. Deposit
4. Transfer Money
5. Quit
